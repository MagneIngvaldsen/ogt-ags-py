AGS Playground
============================

geotechnical engineer hacking ;-)


Pete notes to tony = IMPORTANT
==================================

This is a private repos on bitbucket atmo
and r+d with ags for tony+pete atmo
So we can share mad files.. et all and silly case examples..
proper examples of crashing..
but only in this playgoung for testing...
and making the impossible head scratching true..

We are using bitbucket, for source hosting as
this project is **private** and sone stuff in here is considered **private** data+code..
and stuff here is condidered non disclosure...
eg example files for "real world" and alike...

The idea is to play around and see how things works..
hopefully a plan for ags-toolkit,
ie allowsing developers using open source to play.. 
(or fill holes in current applications - pun intended)
and a constant argument, towards geotechnical heaven ;-))
